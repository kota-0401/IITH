ğŸ”¹ Barrier Divergence Detection
Iterate through all program points.

For each local variable:

Mark 0/1 based on tid dependency.

Identify all __syncthreads() calls.

If inside a conditional branch and condition depends on tid â†’ flag as divergence.

Data Race Detection
Iterate through all program points.

For each local variable:

Track the set of tids accessing it.

On each memory access:

If set of tids at that point > 1 â†’ flag as data race.

Redundant Barrier Detection
Identify all __syncthreads() calls.

At each call:

If set of tids at that point == 1 â†’ flag as redundant barrier.
Temporarily skip the barrier and analyze forward.
If no future variable has tid access set size > 1 â†’ flag as redundant.
